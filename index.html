    <h2 class="secondary">Stage Zero: Getting Started With HTML</h2>
    <h3 class="third">1. Basic HTML Vocabulary.</h3>
      <p class="info">
        <br><b>A.</b>Tag- Foundation of creating HTML.
        <br><b>B.</b>Element- Everything within a set of opening & closing tags.
        <br><b>C.</b>Attribute- Property of an HTML element.
    </p>
  </div>
 <h3 class="third">2. Thinking like a programmer.</h3>
    <p class="info">
      <br><b>A.</b>Procedural Thinking - Taking a problem and breaking it into a series of steps.
      <br><b>B.</b>Abstract Thinking - Finding similarities or generalities amongst different variables.
      <br><b>C.</b>Systematic Debugging - Identifying potential problems track down potential causes find then fix.
      <br><b>D.</b>Technological Empathy - Understanding how a computer functions and sees things.
      <br><b>E.</b>Systems Thinking - Taking a big idea then breaking it down into its component pieces.
  </p>
<h3 class="third">3. What is A Web Page?</h3>
  <p class="info">
      <br><b>A.</b>Text Content (What you see).
      <br><b>B.</b>Markup (What it looks like).
      <br><b>C.</b>Refrences to other documents (Ex: Video & Images).
      <br><b>D.</b>Links to other pages <a href="www.udacity.com">Home</a>.
  </p>
      <h3 class="third">4. How Coding works (i.e. telling it what you want it to do).</h3>
        <p class="info">
          <b>A.</b> Computers are "stupid".
          <br><b>B.</b> They are "stupid" in the sense that they will do exactly what you typed in, reguardless of what the original intent was.
          <br><b>C.</b> Programmers can't remember Everything (or can they...).

    <h2 class="secondary">Stage 1.1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
      <h3 class="third">1. Inline V. Block...Span V. Div</h3>
        <p class="info">
          <br><b>A.</b> These two tags are similar to the break & paragraph tags learned in previous lessons, but have unique characterists.
          <br><b>B.</b> The Span/Br tags are similar in that they are both inline, but Span allows customization of specific parts of a line (i.e. like the color of a certain word or phrase).
          <br><b>C.</b> The Div tag creates boxes, and this is important because a webpage is a series of many rectangular sections.
          <br><b>D.</b> By utilizing Div tags, we are then able to achieve a D.O.M.
      </p>
<h3 class="third">2. Understanding Pros and Cons of Different Web Devleopment Applications</h3>
   <p class="info">
        <br><b>A.</b> Scratchpad - The most basic web development tool that is great for writing initial HTML.
        <br><b>B.</b> Codepen - An intermediate web develeopment tool that allows for further control of HTML (Addition of Javascript) documents and sharing features.
        <br><b>C.</b> Sublime - Expert level web development tool that is reguarded as the most professional, and incorporates all languages.

<h2 class="secondary">Stage 1.2: Creating A Structured Document</h2>
 <h3 class="third">1. Basics of A Structured Document.</h3>
      <p class="info">
       <br><b>A.</b> HTML & CSS are both "languages".
       <br><b>B.</b> HTML controls the "structure" of a web page.
       <br><b>C.</b> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a way to control the style of related HTML elements.
       <br><b>D.</b> D.O.M. (Document Object Model) refers to the Tree-Like structure that can be seen for example if you look at an html file in developer tools.

  <h2 class="secondary">Stage 1.3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Strucutre</h2>
    <h3 class="third">1. So what is CSS?</h3>
       <p class="info">
         <br><b>A.</b> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can serve as a search and replacement tool.
          <br><b>B.</b> "Cascading" means that rules apply not only to the elements, but also to all of the those elements child emelements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more special rules takes effect.
         <br><b>C.</b> By identifying the class, you can then avoid repition in the coding by setting different properties and values.
         <br><b>D.</b> Order matters when you define the rules and in what order they are applied, as precedence takes effect for styling rules.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="third">2. Inheritance</h3>
       <p class="info">
         <br><b>A.</b> Inheritance is a key feature in a CSS Ancestor-Descendant relationship.
         <br><b>B.</b> It serves as a mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also its descendants.
         <br><b>C.</b> Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from an ancenstor element enclosing them.
         <br><b>D.</b> In general, descendant elements inherit text related properties, but box related properties are not inherited.
         <br><b>E.</b> Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over & over in a style sheet by: enhancing faster-loading of web pages by users, and enabling clients to save $$$ on bandwidth & development costs.
        </p>

  <div>
<h3 class="third">3. Repitition</h3>
   <p class="info">
     <br><b>A.</b> Repitition is inevitable when coding, and repitition leads to errors.
     <br><b>B.</b> By utilizing the class system to apply styles to sections of the code, errors can be avoided.
     <br><b>C.</b> Avoiding repitition helps others read your code if any review is necessary.
